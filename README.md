Email.py

This project was used to demonstrate my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming where I have made an Email class and used it to allow users to read and write emails.

In this program users are asked whether they would like to read from their inbox, read specifically unread emails from their inbox, send an email, read an email from their outbox, or quit the application. If the user wishes to read from their inbox they will have the option to delete the email they have just read.
